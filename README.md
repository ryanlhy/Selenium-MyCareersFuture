Bugs
Excel
Occassionally, a header is not formatted correctly in excel, although it looks find when you open the excel sheet
Simply copy the cell that is formatted correctly and paste it back to the affected cell, remembering to change the text to the original header name
You can also move the selecter in excel away from the affected header, that might work sometimes
However, the best way is always to copy into a new file
